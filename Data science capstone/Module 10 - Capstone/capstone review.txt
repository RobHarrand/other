Love/hate

I'm finding that I have a real love/hate relationship with this capstone. Specifically, I love...

1) The fact I've never worked on (or even thought about) NLP before. The challenge of learning all the new stuff is great

2) The fact it's a true project from start to finish, starting with a blank screen and no clue, and ending with a Shiny app and slide-show

3) The lack of help (to an extent!). Some lack of help and guidance is very much like the real world

4) The forums. I've not really used them for the previous modules in the specilaisation, but I'm using them a lot now and enjoying the community spirit



However, I hate (or perhaps 'dislike' is more appropriate)...

1) The quizzes. I don't think I need to say anymore on that from what others have said on the forum

2) The lack of Switftkey help. Surely the video stating we'll get help from Swiftkey should be re-recorded if it's not true? I'm guessing the first few cohorts for this capstone received this help? I've said that the lack of help is a good thing above, but only up to a point. I feel like there is pretty much zero help on this capstone, apart from a few links which Google will give you.

OVerall I'm really enjoying it and my dislikes are far outweighted by my likes.

Would be interested to hear other people's views and thoughts.
