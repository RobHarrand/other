* User enters a phrase and clicks 'predict'
* Up to the top five predictions are displayed
* The user selects one and the phrase is updated. The user can then click 'predict' again


If a word isn't recognised but is in the dictionary, it'll use the KN-unigram bit
If a word isn't recognised and isn't in the dictionary, it'll say 'did you mean?' and offer the nearest match

In that case, the user can select the nearest match and update the phase
If they click no (for example, they've entered a name), it'll use the KN-unigram bit
