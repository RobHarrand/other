so when you thought that your country was still at the cutting edge of freedom and democracy in this turbulent world you were wrong the democracy you thought you had just simply does not exist you have lost the right to free speech your towns and cities are filled with rainbow people and those in power have consolidated their position by ensuring that any person speaking out is deluged under the epithet racist the eu is busy determining where in britain they will build the new slum tenements and towns to house the hundreds of thousands of ethnic persons who will be encouraged to come to do the jobs that the average britain will not do you cannot speak out about it because under the new democracy you will be charged with inciting racial hatred yes it is true democracy no longer exists in britain like most things it is just a distant memory of what we had in the past so forget about voting for your favourite politician and instead go to the pub the results will be just the same

so today during the funeral services i was feeling especially tender and vulnerable it was a lovely and poignant memorial with the family sharing the tributes providing the music and making everyone appreciate being there kathy had the honor and privilege of caring for her mother in her home for the past several months and i was touched and inspired by the loving way kathy surrendered all her own needs to unselfishly and beautifully serve her year old mother she was an example of service and love and i was keenly aware that i could not have done what she did as i listened to all the speakers i was treated to an understanding of why kathy has so many talents and interests as well as outright gifts she was the third and last daughter and in that position in the family she got to witness and learn from all of the others and she has been a stellar student i must say kathy is one of the most exceptionally interesting unique and talented women i know i could see where she got her love of poetry and writing of performing her musical talents and her amazing way with people it has been said that life can only be understood by looking backwards but it must be lived forward the message in its a wonderful life we all need the reminder sometimes of how amazing life is how much we need each other how we are all connected how our lives intertwine and affect everyone around us i must say there was such love in evidence at the funeral and maybe thats the real gift in them i have had three funerals this month all close friends and relatives and i guess im pondering my own mortality since we never know from one moment to the next we need to pay attention to the present and make it count

note that i used a little less of each darker tone so that the overall effect is one of wood you should test your browns since each blending family will feel a little different but they dont always follow the rule of thumb about adding grays as you jump from one family to the next like from the s to the s in this case the e has more gray than the e so it seems darker on the project by adding e last it kept the edges on those thin streaks crisp if i added the dark first it would soften my crisp lines when i added the lighter colors i darkened the edge of the whole piece with the e so it matched the flower better

i know some teachers that hate datadriven education because it can be so much extra work and time to individually assess each kid and it definitely can eat up a lot of time but my first teaching job was at a school that had been labeled failing four years running and i was hired as an interventionist along with or others to help turn it around my job and that school required constant data and while it was a lot to fit in we always knew how each child was doing on every reading and math standard and in reading fluency our groups for researching and rti were changing every weeks at least

nevertheless we more or less overcame that a large spare bedroom was unusable and packed to the gunwales by the time we left our house in lowestoft and things were moreorless reasonable for some time after we moved here especially after we built an extension it all fell apart after weezas wedding when my hip started to give problems and i gradually became less able to keep things together this is not an easy house and it has a large garden and once darling kenny couldnt manage any longer the garden became too much for me i lost heart frankly and the housework suffered too and i left the sage to his own devices devices and desires dear friends his collecting habit extended beyond control he hasnt changed over the years its just that his brakes are not what they used to be and they were always poor i did enough cleaning and tidying to get by and no more and ignored the rest
how wonderful the little connections that pile up in the day to day blanco has long had an interest in the german expressionist painters of the early twentieth century and was interested to learn while reading about them the other day that caspar david friedrich the great romantic painter of lonely figures cast against majestic landscapes was resurrected by the expressionists after falling into obscurity during the latter part of his life when he was deemed halfmad and after his death in friedrich was also taken up by the nazis as embodying the concept of heroic individualism but he can hardly be blamed for that and would in any case had he lived in the s and s have been incarcerated by them as a madman

i dont know if theres anything recognizably mexican in the sinfona romntica in particular its worth noting perhaps that the piece was a louisville symphony orchestra commission but we do know that chavez was a key musical figure in mexico not just as a composer of seven symphonies a number of ballets chamber pieces and other works but also as a journalist and a leader of major mexican musical institutions and ive heard that chavez was interested in native american music themes have been identified in chavezs other works including his symphony no the sinfona india in a fascinating set of preconcert lecture notes from bernstein seemed to define chavezs mexicanness in the romntica in terms of stereotypes as a blend of indian austerity and here bernstein mentioned aztec idols with latin passion and here bernstein crossed out a passage about spanish olive oil

after the initial meeting i got a look at how big the account actually was and learned that it had definitely been neglected needless to say after more than a year to get in the door i wrote my biggest account in the second year of my insurance career it was a huge victory and commission but only because i refused to give up on my efforts to develop that relationship had i listened to other people in my office or even given in to the frustration of constant delays by the decision maker i never would have been able to land that account i later found out that the former cfo was friends with the agent who had been handling the account before me and that is why he wouldnt meet with me persistence and determination paid off in this situation just like they continue for me on other aspects of my life i have always been stubborn when it comes to accepting no as an answer maybe that is what makes me good at sales learn how to be persistent in pursuing your goals and your sales efforts will pay off in the end

whilst writing my last post i came across a charity which offers interesting opportunities for prisoners to engage in projects that provide them with skills and that provide much needed support to those in need the extent to which such charities or workshops exist or actually run in the increasingly over crowded prisons of today i do not know all i know is that i dont believe prison is the answer to todays ills brandishing everyone with the same brush is a crude form of self regulation for society in the same way that one would not use a detention system in school time and again for every student if it wasnt working surely society should look at the way it deals with apparent criminals in light of what have been seen as very harsh recent punishments i do have to question the motives behind them is it a sign of the stresses of todays society or of power crazed individuals are people trying to stamp their authority i say this because frankly i dont understand

a common accusation against the british is that we plundered other countries however it is surely a strangely british form of plundering where a world power moves into a country which has no infrastructure is without health cover without law without education and with a dismally low life expectancy and without exception left them with a world renowned system of law a healthy and educated population a th century infrastructure together with functioning industry and agricultural systems enabling them to be potentially self supporting the fact that the infrastructure has been destroyed agriculture devastated and the industrial wealth pillaged does not change the fact that it was bequeathed to our colonial subjects when we left them

the goras on the panel were a refreshing change i must say much better at answering the questions at hand and anatol lievin in particular was very practical about his responses he talked about the potential in pakistan but also about the challenges that lay ahead something the others missed completely the one thing all goras brought up that was echoed by our beloved pakistani panelists was the level of philanthropy in in the country and how it was unrivaled anywhere in the world i strongly agree with this point as pakistanis as a people have very open hearts and are always willing to give to a good cause even the middle income folks struggling to cope with rampant inflation in the country the problem is a lot of this money is misdirected if we can better utilize this trait of pakistani perhaps get the nation to believe in a system where tax goes to development rather than lining the pockets of the corrupt we could have something it was nice to hear though people with experience from all over the world singling out the philanthropy of pakistanis as something that inspires them

if you have not yet heard the exquisite harmony singing from bulgaria sung sometimes with the accompaniment of the goatbagpipe the gaida i urge you to there is nothing like it ive recommended it before but a harvest a shepherd a bride village music of bulgaria is a wonderful collection of songs which i think is how this painting would sound if you could for a moment swap your ears with your eyes and listen to it anyhow the point is that the painting i worked on up in that tree studio became this below i am very pleased with it and i rarely say this a new tiny paintbrush has led me to paint fine lines describing the shapes of faces and hands and feet with finely diluted oil paint and these differentsized people fit happily into the odd shaped piece of wood singing their bulgarian harmonies while the little fellow plays heartily on his gaida i only managed to take one photo of this painting amid the recent chaos but here it is that first word of the title means sing or we sing unless any bulgarian readers can tell me otherwise

the next movie im excited about is the final part the christopher nolans batman trilogy the dark knight rises ill be honest and say that when i first heard the name of this movie i was pretty disappointed its like some hollywood executive went to nolan and said hey you know how successful the dark knight was well the next movie needs to be just like that only better i know lets name it the same thing and put rises on the end of it yeah thats the ticket to success right there yeah really terrible name guys but im hoping that doesnt steal from the awesomeness of the movie if its anything like its predecessor it should be great
what i thought this book definitely falls on the darker side of the spectrum but its dark in subtle ways and stops short of going into fullon depression mode characters are left with some kind of imperfect hope a lot of the stories illustrate the ways that the traditions and values of the past have settled into an uneasy relationship with contemporary times my favorite stories were prison about a middleaged chinese american couple whose teenage daughter dies which spurs them to travel to china to find a surrogate mother so they can have another child and sweeping past about an elderly chinese woman thinking back on friendship lost overall i thought the collection was a little uneven but i do think lis writing is elegant throughout

there are two kids in the same group in an aikido dojo aikido like most japanese martial arts is rigorously structured every motion is dictated by the sensei practically every breath is choreographed it is indisputably a very controlled experience superficially an observer might say that both kids are having the same experience an equal experience if youre brave enough to use that word after my previous comments about it but of course theyre not having an equal experience by any stretch of the imagination its not even a similar experience in any meaningful sense

naturally galileo is now invoked along with a reference to creationism then we are told that the intolerant christian mobs that came to rule the late roman empire were in turn defeated and driven out of alexandria by even more fanatical muslim armies and rulers who destroyed what little remained of classical civilization that the christians had not already burned or banished again we seem to be in some alternative universes history here since in the real world the naughty old muslims actually took the greek and roman knowledge that had been preserved by wicked byzantine and nestorian monks and expanded on it carrying it to spain where it was eagerly embraced by medieval christian scholars and returned to the west but that story is no fun at all pesky historians and their pesky facts and evidence ruin it for everyone

i left the best part for last because its something i noticed right away and here is why with every new vaccine drug or medical treatment there is always a cost analysis to determine if it is viable to put to market if a procedure costs more than it would profit it is usually shelved vaccines are always checked to make sure that it is profitable and marketable i saw this very early on when i started learning to read studies so i noticed right away that there was some noting at the bottom of the bill stating that any costs could be deferred and it got me thinking about how this bill could possibly be profitable it didnt take long of course to see where the money was going to go and yes this bill will be making people money think about it

the bestknown practice of may day celebrations was of course dancing around the maypole these markers were originally either phallic symbols or treesymbols depending upon which authority one believes in either case the dance was originally a public fertility ritual which survived into christian times though largely shorn of its fertility associations in the public mind after the reformation they were often considered evidence of idolatry and heathenism which to be fair they were and were banned in many protestant jurisdictions maypole ceremonies never caught on widely in the united states though they did sometimes pop up in school celebrations from time to time and still do though much more rarely since the s

despite the action and suspense this book at its heart remains a beautiful tragic love story this time dealing with lost love like all of lauren olivers books pandemonium is gorgeously written and moving and whilst its very different to delirium i enjoyed it just as much one thing that delirium and pandemonium have in common though is that they both have world shattering endings just like at the end of delirium my heart broke all over again leaving me in painful need for the next and final book to this series requiem i have no idea where lauren olivers going to take us next after that ending i really dont but i am excited to find out
monkeyphonic alpahabets dont get me started on this one this started life trying to be a funkrock song because i was heavily influenced at the time by little barrie who are heavy rockin but oh so funky with it but nobody wanted to touch it so i re wrote it as a jazzy vibe all nice and mellow again nobody would play it i was really getting frustrated by this time because i knew that i had something good going down but i wasnt sure how to breath life into it i stuck with it and one day quite out of the blue i was noodling away on the tune that we always warmed up to which was a bastardisation of an old david crosby vibe that he had nicked off neil young and me if the lyrics didnt fit it exactly the chorus just wanted a new set of chords and it was job done everybody liked it we then recorded it with a ten minute version with about guitars all over it the idea was to use a fade out technique but we later decided against this nobody fancied editing it either so i spent a four hour session one evening with ian at airplay just trimming trimming trimming until we had got it down to what i regarded as an acceptable secs bang on and most of the mess cleaned up it still required a considerable amount of work after that to tidy up and make good but the end result is a song that the majority of people say is their favorite magic ship song including a lot of chicks yeah baby if i had a penny for everybody who has said that they have no idea what it is about then id be quite rich by now all ill say is that after sending some lyrics to a mate of mine very early on in my first flush of writing songs he said that i was full of transatlanticisms and general nonsense verbosity by using words such as baby and so forth serves me right for asking for an opinion so i set about writing a song about such verbosity and nonsense i was reminded by a particular episode of south park where cartman is given a monkey phonics play set to help him improve his literacy and i kind of connected with the idea of using the monkey phonics concept to express my feeling at being regarded as nothing much more than a verbose lyricist and this was feed back from a bloke that writes songs about homosexual prostitutes however its not just about verbosity that was just my songwriters gimmick the song eventually became all about

compassion is considered a virtue a measure of moral excellence and a superior trait to have it is also a word that has been coming up a lot in my conversations and in my careful and thorough attempt for more balance in my life i naturally have compassion for animals when it comes to helping an animal i have a strong desire to reach out and make things right by character it is inherent builtin and essential to who i am however when it comes to compassion for my fellow human beings i can be rather limited sometimes i have even been considered heartless and this has me searching deeper not only to figure out why but to grasp the concept of becoming compassionate towards others

in my musings over this ive decided that at least from my own perspective power is not how much money you have or how famous you are or even how worthy your projects are power is your moral and spiritual strength its how you view and operate in the world and beyond true power is to use said power for the good of yourself your loved ones and others even those who are completely different from us sometimes power is in what we dont do or how we stay in control even if we dont feel like it and finally sometimes power is in how we love ourselves others and the world itself at the end of the day authentic power is our ability to love

it has however taken me a while to actually finish reading the book and post this review this isnt because its a hard read or boring quite the opposite for a piece of social sciences its incredibly well written still in a way it is a book that inspires slow reading because one of the many reasons why it took me so long to finish why it takes me so long to finish most books unless i make myself sit and read them in a go or even watch a movie or er finish this sentence is that i get distracted i stop consuming whatever other people have made in this case gauntletts book and go and produce something for myself i knitted i cooked i wrote i gave lectures and organised events some of this i did myself some of it collaboratively along the way i also found stuff other people had made to consume and take part in too and thats why making is connecting might be slow reading because this process of going off and doing something yourself is a lot of what the book is about

i am not saying that people should be gay all i am saying is that it makes sense to be accommodative of them because they are here to stay hell they even make good army generals even in war they just cant leave their friends behind my pastor always said jesus loves you no matter who you are and i agree with him however be cautious where you are told that jesus loves you apparently in mexican and spanish prisons if a person tells you jesus loves you my friend please be afraid be very afraid anyway now i am off to find a noose to hang myself with as i am pretty sure this post has definitely done the same thing to my budding career as a writer
pink i hate you
in all this is one of those novels that bookshops must hate not hard enough to be spec fic not weird enough to be fantasy too realistic for the humour section and yet too humorous to shelve easily with the lit fic and that i suspect is going to prove to be its charm for those who do read it its a singular take on the world and it will either resonate with you or leave you cold but i can recommend that you try itif you like distinctive fiction that rings no bells and blows no whistles but creeps up on you with its absurdities this book will satisfy you as it did me
we had chosen a really cheap hostel because we didnt want to spend a lot of money it had been recommended to us by a friend at dis however im not sure what they saw in the place other than that the staff was really friendly here are my impressions the neighborhood was incredibly sketchy including a few corner stores apartments an erotic massage parlor a hookah store and street lights only on one side of the street the men or should i say boys we encountered in the kitchen within an hour of arrival were selfrighteous male chauvinists who thought that it was completely acceptable to be sloppily drunk by and proceed to hit on anything with a mouth and its not acceptable ever i dont care if youre european those guys were disgusting we were staying in a bed mixed dorm with complete strangers the room smelled like feet and well the place wasnt that clean definitely not the kind of place you really want to kick off your shoes and curl up in the blankets in i slept on my credit cards and phone that night at my request we booked a private room ensuite for the following three nights and i only had to stick it out one night in the slightly sketchy room maybe im spoiled but id like to see you live in a place like that and not gag a few times

a friend of mine who is an academic social scientist likes to say that if you want to know what people believe there are two methods of inquiry a ask them or b observe their behavior its a depressing fact about human nature that if you apply both a and b to a given situation the answers you get will not necessarily be the same whether we are as our current attorney general said a nation of cowards about race i dont know but looking at those residential and educational patterns its awfully hard to deny that we are a nation of liars

see when keri tells our son the plan she doesnt give him all the details in the plan she simply gives him a general overview of the plan so that he knows just enough to have something to look forward to she gives him this overview not because she doesnt know the details but because it would take a little too much time and energy at the end of the day when her knees are about to buckle in reality however our son doesnt need to to know the details of the plan all he needs to know are the characteristics of the one making the plan he needs to know that his mommy loves him that shes trustworthy and that her plans for him are made for his best if he knows these things then he can still sleep soundly at night even if he doesnt know everything he wants to know about the plan

over the past three months the support youve afforded us has enabled these outcomes to happen please be clear that without your support none of this could have happened the orders you have placed with us has enabled us to give the trainees the very best experience of work that could have possibly been given theyve learned so much about the food business but more than that theyve learned so much about themselves they now understand what it is to be a great employee and a supportive colleague and id be proud to give a reference to any one of them i can tell you that their cvs are outstanding and fully reflect their capabilities and qualities and will stand them in good stead for their future careers apart from their practical experience they have spent almost as much time in a classroom setting learning so much about themselves how their past attitudes and actions were hindering them and how a renewed and positive attitude will help them to ensure they secure work and therefore a future for themselves and their families

a few quick observations on the other actors brian keith easily parlays his gruff uncle bill character into a gruff russian scientist martin landau seems to have been in a nutty guy rut in the late seventiesearly eighties that extended here karl malden can make anything sound good look at the streets of san francisco and certainly makes stubbornness an art form as someone were not sure if we should hate or like henry fonda well in the seventies he was either a doctor a fire chief a company ceo a general a colonel or an admiral so i guess we should have come to expect his placement in a movie like meteor as our potus and for as little time and development as fonda gets trevor howard probably gets even less

this is the first year that we have grown jerusalem artichoke and we have been impressed by its abundant harvest from just one plant we dug up more than kg of tubers in our harvesting excitement we made the silly mistake of pulling up all the tubers at once which i suppose is exactly what any first time jerusalem artichoke grower does out of sheer curiosity however they do not store as well as potatoes and need to be used within the week instead what we should have done is left the tubers in the ground and dig them up as needed keeping them in the ground seems to be the best way to store jerusalem artichokes keeping them fresh for months

im not even entirely sure what pulled me back to this tonight ive started a new blog recently considering this one an abandoned housing complex in a japanese suburb its a place i never thought anyone looked at anyway so why bother with it several things have caught my attention tonight however the first thing is that there were actually comments left on some of the posts it amazed me i dont know how anyone ever came across this sad little blog and im not sure why they took the time to read any of it though the things posted here all mean something to me maybe just a bit maybe a great deal it seems surreal they would have captured someone elses attention and the second thing i noticed was that i couldnt remember writing most of this some people keep whatever theyve written in their head for all time for me its gone i have literally read my words before thinking wow this person and i think a lot alike as ive reread things ive been made painfully aware of how many truly personal things ive shared here i dont have a good explanation as to why all the really inner things that youre supposed to keep private it seems as if i went out of my way to put them down on virtual paper to share with anyone who cares to see it i realize also how lonely my life really is not just before but now too there are so few people with whom to share my thoughts that are truly curious it seems that you find someone you believe yourself to connect with and then they remove themselves from your life without any explanation the lonliness still prevails as does my natural melancholia

quarles doesnt finish his run however before revealing who really shot trooper tom i was totally right last week in guessing it was arlo arlo has always been a curious character on the show one often wonders how this man with ambiguous morals and a cutthroat attitude toward the people around him could have fathered raylan a man with a strict sense of morality and empathy but theres no doubt that arlo is crazy like a fox while the whole season has suggested he has been slipping into dementia and rightly so for the most part arlo knows what hes doing when he wants to like taking the blame for killing devil that was a plot quickly taken care of for boyd or killing the man in the hat in probably the most gutting line of the show raylan reveals that he didnt know it was a state trooper he just saw a man in a hat pointing a gun at boyd arlo wanted to kill his own blood to protect boyd his true son

the poets were an odd lot easily given to maudlin sentiment while fiction writers fell by turn to the mimicry of suburban prose the kmart fiction of drunks hypochondriacs usedcar salesmen and adulterous wives that populated the fictional worlds of ray carver anne tyler bobbie ann mason or john updike i had read too much of it all with its facile repetitions of brand names and parkinglot angst and the poets with their gnashing and wailing about poor dead john berryman a suicide or the sad montana taverns of richard hugo just seemed a bit over the top for me i trusted neither

the danger here is that discussions of objects are implicitly governed by a prototype object that functions as the representative of all objects cognitive psychologists treat prototypes as specific examples that function as representatives of abstract concepts think back to the s and the dire reagan revolution many readers will recall all the talk of welfare queens that continues down to this day in discussions of social programs welfare queens were mythological single women on welfare who had multiple children to get larger welfare checks the story goes and who used their money to buy expensive things like cadillacs in short the nonexistent welfare queen came to function as a prototype or exemplary instance representing all people on welfare this prototype caused much mischief in welfare debates and subsequent legislative reforms

over the past year rigby has gotten so much better about trying different foods and one thing that shes started doing is going through cook book and cooking magazines marking recipes she would try her system is pretty simple if it looks good in a picture shell read the ingredients and then decide if its something she would try she saw this recipe in cuisine at home and thought it was something she might like so i made it she wasnt a fan of the cauliflower mainly because of the leeks she also has a firm belief fruit should not be cooked ever i personally loved the combination of cauliflower apple and leek i also liked the fact the entire combination was roasted in the oven overall not a bad dish as i sit here typing this im not certain of hubbys take on the dish as his portion is in the fridge covered in foil waiting for him

each member of battle force has only ever had figure released of them hasbro has never bothered to revisit the concept in either the new sculpt or modern sculpt eras perhaps because calling a futuristic fighting force battle force in the year would be kind of dumb they havent appeared in any of the modern comics produced by various publishers either in the original marvel series where death was a rare thing the entire team with the exception of dodger for some reason was killed as soon as hasbro gave their blessing writer larry hama clearly had no love for the concept my favourite figure of the group was their leader maverick i actually dont recall if he was officially the team leader that may have just been in my head his design is very scifi with a jumpsuit and silver shoulder pads but not so farfetched that he looks out of place with the rest of the joe team his helmet is one of the best removable joe helmets ever designed its cool looking and covers his face entirely except for the eye holes which line up just right when on the helmet doesnt look oversized or clunky which can be tough to pull off the face sculpt has a lot of character he looks more like a hardnosed test pilot whos been through as opposed the giggling manchild persona i saddled him with i actually think this is a great figure and i would love to see all the members of battle force revisited in a modern day pack akin to the dreadnok and renegades packs released last year fingers crossed out of

from a systems perspective however i dont think this conclusion follows the reason for this can already be seen in my remarks above the systems perspective while deeply resonant in certain respects with kantian correlationism emphasizes not the way in which we are trapped within the closure of whatever particular system we happen to be but rather the contingency of any particular organization the point here is twofold on the one hand the environment is always more complex than any system there is never a onetoone correspondence between events in the environment and events in a system on the other hand no system once it reaches a particular point of complexity can relate every element it produces to every other element it produces rather the manner in which elements internal to a system or object are related is always constrained or organized in a particular way when these two points are taken together we get the contingency of systems that is we recognize the manner in which systems could have related their internal elements and relations to an environment differently and thus how any particular organization is contingent and involves risk through secondorder observation or the observation of how other systems relate to the environment we recognize the contingency of our own organization and way of relating to the world

nicholas sparks came back with yet another story of timeless love that definitely sears deeply into ones raw emotions it dwells around two individuals who fell madly and deeply in love when they were young but got separated by the entire world that was against them twentyfive years passed and now with separate lives they never thought their fates would cross once more as both of them were bound to return to their hometown due to the sudden death of someone they both hold dear to their hearts never did they imagine that their visit would relive all their memories in the past stirring their feelings once more and leaving them with the question if love could truly rewrite the past the book reveals their struggle in facing what has become of them during the lifetime they had been apart discovering that once true love settles in it can never go away in the end its just a matter of choice and a series of consequences

we must lay aside every weight everything that would stop us from getting back up again every sin yet we are not left to our own devices in this the way that we lay aside that which weighs us down or a sin that would keep us down is by looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith this is the key to weariness this is the key to every weight that would drag us down every besetting sin as we take our eyes off our circumstances away from everything that holds us down including sin and cast our eyes upon jesus then in his presence we are renewed we must look in the midst of the storm and find jesus we must invite him into the boat we cannot match our own strength with the strength of the storms that will come against us we will exhaust ourselves and get nowhere

it is so unjust that the enemies of jesus christ can foist their evil beliefs upon the faithful and in so doing persecute those who dare to breathe a word of testimony concerning the work of the cross it must be remembered that we as christians are in enemy territory for satan is the god of this world he will do all he can in whatever way possible to make all men embrace the mystery of iniquity

but a word on social media while hesitant at first the authors ive worked with who are naturally industrious fierce and curious have found a second calling in it connecting on social platforms is just another opportunity for fan engagement who doesnt want to meet their fans and hear from readers valuable feedback youll not only develop meaningful virtual relationships which sell your books youll also be far more informed in writing your next book being knowledgeable about what themes in your writing have most resonated once authors get the knack for using social media or crafting opinion pieces theyd never imagined they could write and often for online sites they never thought could be as important attentionwise as they actually turn out to be authors see immediate gratification rather than waiting interminably on a chance tv spot my authors feel more gratified in seeing a google alert pop up for them every day or a splurge of talk on twitter around one of their recent posts and perhaps theres even a new and active follower on their blog whos rallying friends to post and read a fangelist as i call it my authors feel visible and that the book they spent two years writing well someone on goodreads and another on amazon and several more on huffington post and now the la times is calling you for an interview all these people think it matters and my authors and i can watch the momentum in realtime

art that builds strongly on past foundation often becomes blurred together in the minds of the audience in this way often heavy metal bands are no longer interpreted as if theyre making confident strides forward with their musical offerings to the form instead their often decades long contributions are slight and noncumulative this band introduced more orchestral elements perhaps that one plays faster than most this one has some kickass graphic design to go with their extreme metal these arent innovations theyre safe variations there is no one album that cuts through the mists as a definitive statement ergo listeners do not come to these bands to be immersed in a singular world to feel as if the only thing that exists at that moment is themselves and the entity summoned by this mythical piece of art they listen to this music instead on shuffle a records as good as any other all from a distance they can appreciate what the band may be bringing to the table on some intellectual level but theyre not enchanted by the music to the degree that they suspend the language through which they categorize and codify their experience this art is just not startling enough to achieve that it is in this way that say a black metal band in becomes just a black metal band in the riffs might be nice the songs might flow well the black mountains and treetop frost cover is pleasant to look at but all these aesthetic signifiers are gazed upon from a distance with distance comes irony the feeling of being outside and afar from what one feels is a defining aspect of modern life art romantic art in particular was intended as a remedy of exactly that if it fails at eradicating the distance between host and emotion it has failed completely as romance what is left is mostly a comfortable safe product

so why can the doctor change earths history and not his own the most popular theory involves a concept called gallifrean mean time or gmt this states that the universe has an event horizon a present day in effect that advances forwards and before which one can no longer time travel all time lords wherever they are in time and space share this awareness of what is the present even though they are all over the place all over time in different incarnations shot through the universe like a stick of rock only one of those incarnations is ever the present time lord the rest are fixed past selves or possible futures the twist in the tale is that this present day is actually still billions of years in the past and earth is actually just a probable future planet made more probable it must be assumed by the amount of its future history that has been fixed in place by the doctor and other time travelers experiencing it gmt also explains why there is only ever one president of gallifrey at any given moment why the doctor knows what time period to visit if he gets a distress signal from his own world and why he only ever meets the master one time after another in a linear order despite jumping between times and places it also explains why there was only five doctors to choose from at the time of the five doctors and not thirteen most of all it explains why he can never see his own people again despite them all being time travelers the event horizon of the present has passed by the destruction of gallifrey committing it to the past and he can never go back there nor can anyone from there ever be in the same place as him at the same time the doctor has to obey the second law of time travel just as surely as we have to obey the law of gravity he can bend it but he cant break it there are things that are lost to him forever

i have had some unexpected time this afternoon and so decided to put together a quick post i am feeling so very grateful right now as my mom is doing soo much better we played cards again friday night after bringing them over a little dinner and giving my mom a beautiful bouquet of flowers in honor of mothers day the fragrance of flowers was soo sweet and somewhat overwhelming in their small place but we all just loved it the girls have won two weeks in a row btw and so we are on a definite roll it seems haha she has only been off the medication days but it has already made such a big difference she was much more clear headed and walked around pretty good in fact when she used her walker she was downright speedy lol she was just so much happier what a relief now i wont pretend that she was percent but then neither am i most of the time my step dad does continue to go down hill and has become so thin it is truly unbelievable he sits at the table in obvious pain using his oxygen with his hands shaking from fatigue and yet he is as sharp as he ever was and was in high spirits just because my mom was doing so much better i know he hangs on just for her and plays cards when he would probably be more comfortable doing nothing at all because he knows she wants to play i have watched him love for her for almost years now and i can tell you she is one blessed lady to have him it is really hard for her to watch him decline and i have absolutely no idea how she will ever manage without him

this is a sweet little album of early s british rock r b based with some slight proggy touches this reissue used a terrible cover i dont know what a slingshot has to do with anything and had only some brief production notes no booklet no liner notes no photos disappointing because this band is still around and im sure the members would have loved for the label to have done a better job i mean i had to search the net to get the players names well anyway the music speaks for itself very nice material well produced with great keyboards throughout and a singer whose voice perfectly suits the music not the greatest album ever but certainly not deserving of being so obscure all these years

thailands military culture has always allowed for the use of force when opposition calls out and has been seen multiple times over the past three or four decades with violent crackdowns against its own people during mass demonstrations whether peaceful or not if strength and force can be used against their own people it is not a far cry to pushing out those who may not culturally belong in thailand those who create a heavy burden on the country and who originally were meant only to be temporary residents but have now been forced to create permanent settlements for more about thai military crackdowns through an anthropological lens an excellent book is funeral casino meditation massacre and exchange with the dead in thailand by alan klima
words fail one must use words and then extrapolate from them attempt to use them to transcend themselves love is a word that stands for an idea a concept which in this context is inadequate to the extreme in the culture by which these mindbodies are conditioned love is held up as the highest value but we seldom examine what we mean by it like most of our thoughts and values it is surrounded protected by fuzzy thinking to avoid the clarity which leads to selfexamination which can lead to awakening to seeing through the mist of this world which has been pulled over our eyes to blind us to the truth

weve heard this story time and time again from fanatics with mental health issues do all fanatics not have some mental health issues but i cant help but wonder why their mental state seems to so often manifest itself in religious or social intolerance and violence what is it about our society that causes crazy i use this word for ease but i dont like it and dont think that it gives the complexity of mental health issues their proper dues people to often be crazy in specific ways are these people genetically inclined to be terrorist religious fanatics bombing churches mosques planned parenthood centers or military recruiting posts its all just very strange to me i cannot understand what makes these people do what they do and i probably never will i just thought it was an interesting thing to think about why they do what they do or more specifically why they are the way they are instead of just calling them crazy or insane or some other euphemistic word that doesnt really do justice to the range of mental health issues that they may be dealing with

you know how they say that its not the journey but the destination success is awesome but its not the endall beall its not just about hitting a target its also what you do after youve reached your initial goals are you just going to take it easy and switch off your motivation switch or are you going to make new goals and challenge yourself these choices represent your desire to grow as a person sure you dont always have to move on to a new project right away but it is important to ask yourself how can i do things better heres the thing people change whether you like it or not think about it are you the same person that you were years ago were never static and always remain in motion even after youve earned your first million youre either moving forward or backward although you should never take your current success for granted you do need to understand that everything you do in the present will either help you evolve or decline besides youre not the only one the rest of the world is also in a state of constant change this means you need to avoid being complacent to stay on top of your game and adapt to evershifting circumstances in many ways longterm success is not just about adding another trophy to your collection in the greater scheme of things it boils down to maintaining the same attitude and mindset that made you successful in the first place the way to do this is to stay sharp stay hungry

the opposite of freedom is constraint to constrain is to imprison force or severely restrict constraint is a consequence of sin just as shame limits our ability to see one another in innocence constraint limits our ability to make a free gift of ourselves this constraint is manifested in many ways and we feel it in the form of uncontrolled passions especially the urge to misuse each other is toxic to freedom this results in a lack of freedom to give oneself without the ability to give of ourselves we lose the ability to know who we are by inhibiting our freedom to give of ourselves the constraints of sinuncontrolled passionstouch precisely on our ability to be known and find ourselves we must learn selfcontrol in order for us to achieve freedom

our first course was a garden salad and then we could choose irish stew or a poached salmon with white wine dill sauce i had the salmon which was fantastic i also tried a bite of the stew which was excellent dessert was homemade apple pie with fresh cream which was beyond yummy the last thing served was traditional barm brack this is a yeasted bread with raisins it is sweeter than bread but not as sweet as cake it is actually a halloween tradition that was used as a fortune telling game inside the bread was baked a pea a stick a piece of cloth a small coin and a ring if you had the piece with one of the items it meant something the pea meant that the person would not marry in the year the stick to beat ones wife with meant that the person would have an unhappy marriage or continually be in disputes the rag meant that one would have bad luck while the coin meant good luck or fortune the ring meant that the person would be wed by december at our feast we were told that there were only rings in the barm brack and to see who got it jemma dug through that bread like nobodys business and while she was looking away the fear an ti slipped a ring onto her plate she was ecstatic

dr ingraffea explains that the kernel of the myth that fracked gas is clean fuel is based on the fact that burning gas produces less of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide than burning coal or oil however during production there is much leakage and waste of gas some of it is flared or burned which has to be added to the total effect much of it simply escapes as methane over its life cycle as it is drilled and transported most natural gas is methane methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas in its own right it has substantially more powerful greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide by many multiples but over a somewhat shorter time period because it lasts in the atmosphere as methane for about years once carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere it is there for all practical purposes permanently some companies flare their escaping waste methane to destroy it but dr ingraffea reports that others like shell have a policy not to perhaps shell feels that flaring provides too conspicuous a reminder of the waste and escaping gas

true narcissists are more problematic as helping them often involves delving deeper into the psyche underneath the bravado and attentionseeking they are not all that selfconfident or sure of themselves rather they suffer with intense feelings of inadequacy with which their audience helps them cope because lack of selfconfidence is not often a trait of successful executives it is imperative that these feelings be hidden from peers subordinates and coaches the narcissist will find negative feedback demoralizing and exhibit emotional responses based upon the perceived challenges to his or her personality much coaching work will revolve around helping the narcissist resolve internal conflicts and regain the approval of his or her audience

the second book is more ambitious and in some ways more satisfying being rooted in alltooreadily imaginable reality the submission by amy waldman reconstructs the process of choosing the memorial for the site of the twin towers but imagines a scenario where the winning design chosen anonymously from thousands of submissions was created by a muslim architect before the selection has been announced to the public the selection committee is torn apart by the resulting conflict the book was written before the controversy about the proposed muslim cultural centre at ground zero but eerily foreshadows it the characters are complex and beautifully drawn with their frustratingly dogmatic thoughts and opinions never quite behaving the way they should and never quite making the matter an easy one

millenium is a film that resembles many others that came before and after it the one it resembles the most is james camerons the terminator theres the time travel angle theres the love story between someone from the past and someone from the future if you look at it the terminator is also a love story at heart millenium also reminded me of alfonso cuarons children of men because of the whole thing about humanity loosing the ability to procreate though in reality this is a recurring theme in post apocalyptic films it has the quintessential sequence in which someone has to explain the whole logic of time travel ala doc brown in back to the future ii which strangely enough was released in the same year only with far superior visual effects i guess even for its time milleniums production values where kind of low and goofy visual effects wise millenium seems to have stayed back in time which could explain the films low box office intake speaking bluntly the film was a box office bomb

well basically it is not something new and you also can find actual true pictures of israeli soldiers acting immoral as well as you can of many other armies or militant groups we can always find actual examples on people acting wrong or worse than mere wrong but this picture in itself is an example of people acting this way than rather than being honest even in their dislike of israel chose to go that step further and engaged in slander we have to react against actions like this as well as react against the soldier had the picture been true acting like this but the problem here is that pictures always tell what the presenter wants them to tell always the notion a picture tells more than a thousand words is true but it should be expanded to a picture tells more than the thousand words the sender wants to tell about a story whether true or false we dont know what really happened in context of any given picture only what the person presenting it wants us to know about it and maybe heshe wishes to give a certain story which goes according to the reality heshe wants people to believe then that is what the picture will tell but thats the actual pictures themselves this is worse this is not a true picture this is a lie presented as truth in order to give someone a bad name in order to spread hatred that cant be excused no matter what and i simply have to react against it

how long do you have to concentrate to be able to go through so many pages just in case this is not seen as a rhetorical question assuming you are a slow reader like me or the book to be read is not the da vinci code it takes about one hour to read pages that means more than hours to read pages though it took me around hours to read the last harry potter with pages around pages an hour with an audiobook you dont have to concentrate on the written word and here comes a disadvantage with an audiobook it isnt easier to be distracted there is no deadtree evidence to guilt you into concentrating you need will power and certain skills to do so more on skills in part

the one thing im pretty confident about is svu is back at p i assume nbc will finally try to give this show a decent more compatible lead if they do greenlight a number of multi camera comedies wed might be a good place for of them as there are none represented here and they did do decently with whitney by itself i really dont think theyll attempt to put comedies even multi cams at the comedy audience is so well served with modern family i think they might go for a new drama earlier in the year i would have suggested moving grimm here it has a devoted audience and is counter programming to everything else in the hour and skews younger but at this point i think it stays on fri could they possibly air chicago fire here which is different enough from criminal minds and comes from dick wolf and will probably be the most compatible lead to his own svu yes it will likely come in th but it could still do a and come in th and nbc would happily take a at which will also give svu its best lead in its had in a long time another option might be a one hour the biggest loser at which should give them a against tough competition and keeps them from sacrificing a new drama there im gonna guess that nbc airs their two best new multi cams at p maybe lady friends and table for three two female led adult multi camera comedies which will contrast with the family oriented single cams on abc

in early times we read of the one church of and its adherents called themselves christians or more specifically orthodox christians especially when living in areas where there were many gnostic heretics who also claimed to be christian the faith given by christ and upheld by orthodox christians was thus from and early time called the orthodox faith signifying right belief and correctly giving glory to to convey that this church was universal and bore the completeness of christ it was again from the earliest times also called the whole or catholic church from the greek word katholikos literally in accord with the whole but soon other groups such as the arians and the donatists or cathari would also call themselves the catholic and apostolic church claiming to be the true catholics or pure catholics thus the church even more heavily employed the term orthodox to distinguish it from the heretics and schismatics who left the church for doctrines and practices not handed down from the apostles but never ceased to continue to utilize the terms catholic and apostolic in centuries following many nations would also come to christ the largest conversion in the history of christendom being that of the northern lands of kyivan rus which today is known as ukraine or rusukraine and would spread christianity northward and eastward in the various rusyn peoples which today may find themselves more specifically as ukrainians russians ruthenians poles slovakians czech and belorus

but actually this stripping away of context i think vitiates the drama the oppressive small minded village hysteria simply becomes hateful mob antics which i found far less disturbing than brittens original vision lots of individuals normal but with their own puculiarities are galvinised and united by their hatred of a single man in this production the townspeople arent established as normal so their rejection and persecution of grimes and ellen orford isnt so jarring they just all seem like unequivocal badies from the start this was also the cause of another problem it took quite a while for the individual character portraits of the towns people to come through too not until act ii did they really establish themselves

last friday andrew and i had dinner with a few people at a friends house i cant remember when i think after our first loss i found out that our friend nicole had a week loss on either side of that loss she has two beautiful girls ages and and a half other than that loss nicole has lost a lot of people in her life its probably hard for people to understand the immensity of her losses when most people have only lost a couple people in their lives by their mids i dont mean to diminish anyones loss losing even one person in your life is difficult but i think that when several people in your life die it definitely takes its toll on you its also different when its your grandparents who lived long and fulfilling lives compared to your sister who left behind her two kids i dont think she gets to really talk about it well once in awhile you just need a pity party and isnt alcohol always the best catalyst for it

i dont consider it a redux if it isnt just a bit different from the original experience so while these cupcakes adhere closely to the recipe shared by sprinkles candace nelson they are given an extra intensity of flavor courtesy of adrienne at gastroanthropology and her recipe for slow roasted strawberries the additional time required in adriennes process is worth every minute as these simply sweet cupcakes achieve a depth of strawberryness that may be lacking from plain fresh or frozen berries the pure made from the slowroasted fruit is used in both the cake batter and the icing but the flavor really shines in the latter happily the frosting recipe yields more than enough for a dozen cupcakes so lay it on thick or eat it by the spoonful either way its pinkhued bliss

in an era when extending state power was all the rage opposition to it could be calumnied as motivated only by dislike of any change political conservatives of course always denied that charge vigorously and in fact have always clearly believed in progress for instance the major conservative political party in altemeyers own country canada for a long time called itself the progressive conservative party it is that very belief in progress that now tends to bring conservatives into conflict with environmentalists so that it is they the conservatives who promote change while the environmentalists oppose it the obvious lesson is that we all now seem to have no alternative to accepting what the conservatives have always claimed that it is your attitude to state power that determines where you stand on the rightleft divide of practical politics conservatives reagan thatcher want limited state power influence and intervention while leftists stalin brezhnev li peng want a lot of it altemeyer however shows no awareness that this debate ever took place

i believe that both of those men have high moral standards and a keen desire to maintain a healthy united states within a healthy world but my contention is that they are in a position to abuse their enormous powers and there wouldnt even be a potential for redress of grievance by any individual or even other governmental organizations they presently know their powers and their limitations and they also know they can do as they please with little chance of corrective punishments being inflicted if there is no anticipated censure there is no reason not to abuse their power the supreme court has the power to constrain abuse of power but five of the nine members are from the same watchdog kennel the harvard law school and are led by roberts one of their own from that same elite group there are approved law schools in the us but one law school has five of the nine supreme court seats thus there is little chance of the jealous conflict intended by the constitution and little chance of restraining abuse of power that is unquestionably an overconcentration of political power which the constitution was designed to prevent but what compounds this potential abuse of power is that our president also comes from that same tiny sliver of american society harvard law school that is even compounded because both the chief justice and the president come from a fragment of that fragment the constitutional law subsection of the harvard law school how strange it is that the most informed people on the planet of the intent of the constitution are the very ones who are violating the most cherished principle of democracy the separation of powers

for all of its absurdities and offkilter sense of humour however the novel is very much rooted to its time and place by the event that looms in the background of the story from the very beginning that of the assassination of john f kennedy in dallas that event doesnt fully escape the gravitational pull of the novels absurd tone shushan cats is a longtime friend of jack ruby at one point cats a former crack marksman with the marines is considered a suspect for the assassination but there is a pervasive sense that the killing of jfk for all the mans personal faults to which shushan testifies at every opportunity marks something of a watershed in modern american history that america took a turn for the worse on that fateful date in november

in such circumstance i think it is important to seek out someone who is confident in experience yet humble in it the confidence will free you to relax and be vulnerable the humility will give you room for letting your own confidence rise you wont be so intimidated by your own sense of spiritual distance on the other hand such humility will mean your friend will be less likely subtly probably unconsciously to exploit your newness by lording it over you with superior sounding overconfident advice which you mistake for wisdom your friend will listen gently evoking from you the light of the spirit within

you will note that there is some wiggle room in these statements it is almost certain that humans are responsible nasty things will probably happen that is because all science can ever be is the best guess of the best minds also the climate is a complex system meaning it can behave in ways that are opaque beyond our most sophisticated calculations but as i have often been told those statements are as true as any scientific statements can be and nobody i repeat nobody has been able to refute this in short to deny any of these statements is to put yourself beyond the bounds of rational discourse
we sometimes realize that we are not living our best life and when we are in deep thought someone comes and asks us or a cup of coffee and we forget everything that we were thinking and get busy in everyday chatter i mean how can we allow someone to control our thoughts so the best practice as so many of the motivational speakers and leaders suggest is to keep writing your thoughts feelings and goals and keep reminding yourself after every minutes because we tend to forget so easily write your goals on a flash card and keep it in your pocket and keep reminding yourself about them every mins put an alarm on your mobile which rings every mins and reminds you of your goals

netley could have been forgiven for thinking the game was over at halftime having won sixteen of their previous eighteen league games they can also include reigning southampton premier league champions bush hill as one of their scalps having beaten them in the semifinals of the trophyman cup they trounced second placed allbrook last week in a game that went some way to decide who would win the divisional title perhaps the confidence they had taken from the victory turned to complacency in the spring sun our mood at the final whistle was in stark contrast to the silence of halftime although paul dyke reminded us that we had come back from twonil down twice this season albeit against inferior opposition the statistic didnt seem to register with us we looked embarrassed at having believed we could give netley a run for their money

none of this did him any favours in practical reallife terms some friends revered him but a much larger proportion considered him eccentric and odd if not outright mad blake was one of those artists and poets who are not much appreciated in their own lifetimes he always struggled to make a living and financial and social success eluded him and yet he was rightly convinced of his own genius so much so that one cant feel the pity for him that one feels for vincent van gogh or john keats dying before they could know of their own undying fame blake was so certain of the worth of his work the truth and grandeur of his visions that public recognition though doubtless it would have been welcome was not essential to him

a book that melds memoir with fiction folk tale with fantasy sadulaevs account of the conflict in chechnya doesnt fit into any easy categories and is all the more exciting for it it may not be consistent but the early sections in particular are stunning in the way they weave chechen myth with personal testimony to create something that manages to be grand and specific at the same time infused with the guilt of a man who wasnt there when things were at their worst sadulaev uses his creativity instead to speak on behalf of a people and give voice to a conflict the like of which all too easily passes us by on the ticker tape of rolling news

it wasnt long before a few of them decided to cross the road and engage us in debate one of them was particularly aggressive and after unsuccessfully trying to intimidate a few activists on our side he was laughed back across the road where he sulked behind a placard for the remainder of their protest another fundamentalist christian attempted to explain the scientific basis behind the story of noahs ark claiming there was no evidence to support evolution perhaps the most shocking though was a woman who came over with her placard to engage with us when confronted with difficult questions she astonishingly suggested that women who fall pregnant as a result of being raped should see it as a blessing and carry the child to term needless to say this comment wasnt very well received

i read somewhere an argument that speaks to me on this film studios have no real problem with test screening a movie for audiences across the nation the director of the movie doesnt just drop some film reels off on some producers desk and walk away theres constant tweaking even after its been called done what are directors cut editions if not either the movie as the director originally envisioned it or tweaks to the film after it was shown to audiences book authors are a different matter but they still have editors looking out to make sure the book is as cohesive as they can make it heck even published works can get a brandspanking new epilogue after the books been out for a while so why is it that this video game which has much more flexibility in terms of lastminute tweaks is suddenly supposed to be set in stone nobody calls the test audience for movies whiny entitled brats if they didnt like the ending it means somebody misjudged the audience and if its a serious enough misjudgement is that even a word then the studios fix it so even these other works of art are fixable right up to and beyond the point of publicationscreeningdistribution

i was interested in finding out why a school failed to get at least one pupil who passed national examinations and the discoveries i made were fascinating yes communities may be disadvantaged in terms of resources however one of the key areas has been addressedthanks to the donation of text books by unicef in conjunction with the education ministry the books however continue to be condemned by certain people with an agenda that is meant to discredit anything that is perceived to be western surely textbooks as a resource in schools are important whether they come from the united kingdom government just as computers are necessary even if they are a chinese donation but that is something for another time

its not just isolated instances such as the suarez incident ask most liverpool fans what they think of alex ferguson and youll probably hear once youve picked through all of the swearing about his propensity for a glass of wine his oddly coloured nose his famous temper and why he shouldnt have sir in front of his name there will unlikely be any mention of the numerous titles that his manchester united team have stockpiled over the years

in the case of haiti theres every reason to think that aid delivery is going to be slow and far slower than appears acceptable in the face of a disaster of this magnitude it will be easy to point the finger at governments charities and the un for not overcoming obstacles in their way and doing what theyre supposed to do best however lets take a moment and look at why aid has been and will continue to be slow reaching haitis victims
at least years festival festival director andrew migliore announced that hed be stepping down there was rumbling that the festival would still continue in portland a satellite festival popped up in california thanks to mr vanek but for a good part of this year there was little to no talk about a h p lovecraft film festival happening in portland when an announcement was made i know it sounds silly but i felt a rush of relief for years ive joked that october doesnt begin for me until the hpl film festival but theres a lot of truth to that its become a tradition for me i get to see old friends and watch some fantastic movies in a comfortable setting the hollywood theatre although i think some of the comfort comes from the familiarity of the building and the event rather than the actual accommodations although it has gotten better over the years

i know ive done quite a lot of whinging already but i must add that this item was a real bother to block given its shape now that i look at the photos i can see that a few hundred more pins and even more attention to setting the details perfectly would have made the more intricate sections a little more noticeable and really what is the point of labouring over work like row if you dont showcase it properly silly me one bright note however is that the pain of blocking was partially alleviated by the glorious scent left by the flora soak i used when bathing my preblocked tango flora soak is a product so deliciously soft and floral that im seriously considering using it in the shower

another reason for watching it was that the movie was definitely in the back of my mind when i was writing mister creecher the idea of teaming two misfits one a teenager the other a kind of superhuman certainly had something to do with my memory of terminator in particular the scene where john connor realises that he can make the terminator do whatever he says the glee with which he realises that he has a nearindestructible killing machine at his disposal is immediately tempered by his feeling of responsibility as soon as the terminator starts to act on his orders i knew i wanted that tension to exist in my novel although billy never actually has control over mister creecher in that way

swanson was indeed one of the great stars of the silent era swanson worked at paramount pictures and with cecil b demille for a time she was the highest paid star in hollywood in that respect she was born to play the role some say that the role was based on another silent film star norma talmadge the similarities however happily end there the scene in which she appears with demille who plays himself and meeting desmond after a long absence is a heartwarming one in terms of their history and careers demille refers to desmond as young fella in the scene a name he lovingly created for swanson

my major issue with the books was that none of the students seemed like year olds i hate when people make that comment about ya books so let me explain all the students live with french host families but apparently none of the families have any compunction about letting their wards run around paris at all hours of the night none of them worry when the students come home drunk and none of them even question the constant coming and going of new friends and acquaintances a few times the characters refer to their host parents and two even mention that they share rooms with younger french siblings but still theres no worry about going home drunk it bothered me i think the author could have made the students college age without much difference in the stories and avoided a lot of my qualms

i have always been opposed to phoniness fake positivity and sales in general i hated the pseudofriendliness of the salesperson the stereotype of the car salesman i put a premium on genuine interaction honesty and just being real so it has come as quite a surprise to me that i am enjoying sales and being engaging with the public however i am still being true to my principles i am not phony baloney we are not taught to be inauthentic just to be upbeat and positive in a genuine way it is not necessary to share our anxieties problems or anger this is not only a buzz kill it changes the tone of the interaction from being transformational to being entropic entropy is the tendency for any system to break down to corrode to become disordered you know entropy is what you see happening to the occupy movement when you share negative information in a way that isnt constructive and doesnt contribute to the bond you are seeking to establish you add to the entropy everybody dies just a little we dont want that but this does not mean being a robot with a false smile actually when you reach down into your innermost desires you find what you need share that everyone wants to love to be enthusiastic to share their knowledge to bring more happiness into another persons life when you tap into that genuine desire you can be positive without being robotic this is transformational retail so how do i manage to keep being upbeat in the face of all attempts to bring me down i focus on the purpose behind my interaction which isnt to sell an item or just to shuffle someone along it is to make a difference in their life even if it just consists of a moment of genuine pleasantness definitely keep it real but you know what anger and confrontation argument and making other people wrong isnt keeping anything real it is the false face which produces a dark veil which obscures the love we all feel for each other and yes even though it may embarrass us to admit it we do actually love each other no need to make a big deal about it it is just a fact consider it an inconvenient truth or use it as an opportunity for transformation

mattie had always sat in the middle of the bus it was a tradition born from a lingering moment of heartache and as long years rolled on over miles of bus fare the position of her place in the middle became her way to reconnect her with lost opportunities fizzled dreams and dusty loves each trip she placed herself as close to the middle as she could mattie would fantasize that her wishes could be delivered just for sincerity of heart alone only if greta would turn up beside her as though nothing had ever happened and that would be the end of the whole regretful affair but the meaning of life as matilda mathers saw it was nothing more then a fairly swift kick in the proverbial sack as the years and miles passed along behind her mattie became victim to the immediate relegation of the elderly to the front of the bus she found herself receiving the overly kind company policy which eventually began as a repetitive suggestion that she would be might feel more safe and comfortable in the very front reserved with a warmly condescending tone reserved for the very young and the very old nothing but watching high way and thousands of bumper sticker laden tail ends to ponder admitting frailty is a

the notion that all religion is bad is a false assumption based on negative experience we dont want to give people a bad taste in their mouth so we deceptively present christianity as if there are no restrictions attached all you have to do is admit that youre a sinner and accept jesus into your heart once they have fallen for the bate and switch they get into the mess that is christianity and find that there are a lot of disagreements on how they ought to live after they are saved presenting the notion that we can kneel at the cross for salvation without taking up our own in sanctification is a classical trick which leaves the church with a lot of christians who only have one foot in the door
are such programs and the bwas is not the only one worthwhile not in my opinion literary agents are already the middlemen of the publishing world as such they expect to be approached by writers directly and theres really no need for an intermediary to add another layer to the process plus as tempting as it may seem to have someone else do the work for you its far more effective to control the process yourself since you know your own work best and thus can best research and choose whom to approach

the second book emphasises the critical significance which an understanding of material culture has played in our developing understanding of history you will look at the way scholars have used the study of objects and their contexts to shed light on a specific period of european history from about to in particular the focus is on the place of objects in the wider culture of the age and how they illuminate our understanding of religious and intellectual developments during the reformation and renaissance in the first two chapters you will study the central role that sacred objects played in the everyday lives of europes catholic population and the extreme reaction to them in protestant circles culminating in the mass destruction of much of the material culture of the medieval past during the reformation in the final two chapters you will examine how technical developments in creating objects encouraged new ways of thinking about and understanding the world this will be through case studies concerned with the origins of the printed book and the preparation of anatomical specimens

my fourth favorite single of april is the absolutely stunning return of one of my longtime favorites and most influential songwriters of my lifetime fiona apple i absolutely adore this song it is the first single from fionas upcoming th studio album the idler wheel this song is like classic fiona apple but taking things in a very new direction for her this song is more upbeat than much of her past music and has a really fun lighthearted sound this song to me kind of flutters like a butterfly this sounds like i am letting fiona apple rub off on me and waxing poetic but i just mean that it has a very light airy sound but then weaves in some heavier elements i dont know how to explain it except to say that you should definitely listen to it for yourself lyrically this is really just a song about feeling the need to clear your mind while also wanting to really feel and experience everything in your life which is definitely something that i can relate to like i said i definitely think that you all just need to listen to this song for yourself

a few days ago i was asked to describe my teaching style this is what i wrote i differentiate for diverse learning styles and second language learners my lessons incorporate direct instruction and highlevel wholeclass or smallgroup discussions followed by creative independent work some will rightly point out that this teaching style is already practiced by many it is known as the gradual release of responsibility grr method of instruction students know it as the i the teacher do it we do it together you do it independently plan in theory the method makes perfect sense it allows for direct instruction and modeling group discussions and cooperative learning and independent work but in practice it has one fatal flaw priority is given to group work so that the amount of time students spend working independently is minimal usually the last few minutes of class if teachers follow this method they will probably please their principals which lets face it is a big deal especially nowadays but their students will not develop the necessary stamina for prolonged focused creative independent work

it was a beautiful sunny morning with little wind beautiful running weather my marathon went pretty well for the first miles i hit miles at not fast but not terrible either id been having twinges of cramps but was able to keep running through them after things went downhill by miles i was cramping regularly by i was doing a fair amount of walking and a lot of stopping to try to massage out my leg cramps predominantly in my adductors and hamstrings they were relentless id never had to stop so many times i walked most of the last miles mile was and mile was ouch literally i was moaning and crying even the adductor cramps are so incredibly painful many people stopped to see if i was ok or needed transport to the finish beth wengler came by several times on her bike to give me water a stranger gave me his water bottle then another stranger gave me water from a bottle they were carrying i had no idea whod drank from these bottles but i didnt care i was really warm had stopped sweating had salt stains all over my clothes and was dearly wishing id had my electrolytes kate adams came by in the last mile and had a bag of coarse salt which she shared with me salt tasted great twice when i was unable to move either leg due to several muscles in each leg spasming i didnt think id finish the second time i was less than mile from the finish right after i finished they handed me water and my muscles were spasming so bad that they eventually put me in a wheelchair they wanted me to lay down but i know from experience what happens then i cant get up so i downed two bottles of water and a cup of broth and kept walking around until the cramps released i had a few in the car on the south side of the cities but for the most part after i stopped running they quit anyway im very embarrassed at my finish time my marathon times are getting slower and slower and slower so discouraging im proud that i finished but embarrassed at my time how do i feel today pretty good actually but the muscles that cramped are pretty tender as they usually are after such an episode the adductors insidemedial side of upper leg are the worst number in the books i hope i can pop a decent one in the not too distant future

david halperins recent book what do gay men want explores the possibilities of a retheorization of gay subjectivity in opposition to the psychological questions raised by the putative rise in gay mens increasingly risky sexual behavior let me summarize very briefly halperin argues that the moralizing public conversation about barebacking slides easily and quickly into a psychologically repathologizing discourse that locates gay male subjectivity in the perverse abnormal dieased selfhating etcthe very discourses gay men and women have been working to overthrow since at least the s halperin explains the rise in risky behavior in signifantly different terms seeing gay men as ongoing agentnegotiatorsresisters who opt for safer strategies of risk reduction to maximize or maintain access to pleasure he uses epidemiological and sociological research to demonstrate the rationality as opposed to pathology but not in a rational choice sense of the word of gay mens sexual choices in the face of what is known about hiv transmission and moves to an etended engagement with an essay by michael warner from a village voice in which warner discloses his own risky behavior and calls for an explanation and engagement with gay male subjectivity on its own terms the essay is of great importance to those working in public health in hiv prevention among men who have with men but im going to leave aside those issues for my purposes here in talking about the implications of halperins emergent theory of gay male subjectivity and what it ma reveal about the gay men i studied and the normative conclusions i drew from my research

the shape the church of england took during elizabeths reign is often described as the elizabethan settlement the elizabethan settlement did not establish the english church as a via media between rome and geneva as the tractarians would claim in the nineteenth century the two poles that the elizabethan settlement holds in tension are the churches of geneva and zurich both churches are protestant and reformed in faith as would be the church of england where they differ is in the spheres of church governance and discipline and the relationship of the church to the state the english adopted the model of zurich and a number of other swiss reformed churches in these churches the state governed the church and the church acted as the conscience of the state while in geneva the church governed the state and was its own conscience

similar to the above second on the essentials list are trainers lets get real here the trainers you wore before and during pregnancy may no longer be suitable its not uncommon for pregnant womens feet to swell up to one shoe size so if when you put your dusty old trainers on for the first time since giving birth that they feel too tight chances are they need replacing a lot of new mums come to me saying they suffer with knee pain the first thing i do is take a look at their trainers and times out of theyve had it so if youre serious about getting back into shape youve got to look after your very foundation which are your feet trainers should feel comfortable and give you adequate support too just like your sports bra so dont just buy trainers because they look good theyve got to feel good too trainers come in all shapes and sizes and styles but youve got to know the difference between a cross trainer and a running shoe for example so ask in store what sorts of activities each shoe is designed for when you try them on

the problem with religious jackwagons is not that theyre religious its that theyre jackwagons if they werent religious they would be some other kind of jackwagon is jackwagonry impossible to change certainly not but trying to cure it by going for the religion is not in line with empirical evidence there are too many of my fellow atheists who are reprehensible for me to believe that religious beliefs are a meaningful contributor to just being a really awful person we as atheists should be smarter than that

the pacing and action is topnotch and superior to uglies the novel moves at a fairly steady pace and switches perspectives between deryn and alek at fairly regular intervals one of the best things about this is seeing dylan through aleks eyes and then seeing deryns perspective theres even a pair of chapters towards the end that does my favorite thingthey show the same short period of time from vastly different views deryn the swashbuckling soldier she is weathers storms and battles and thinks very quickly on her feet even using alek as leverage at one point theres plenty of dangling from ropes attached to the leviathan and leaping off the side for deryn aleks adventures deal more with piloting his war machine a storm walker stealthily through the night however alek does gets to engage in a few thrilling battles of his own

such an unexpected display of concern for the feelings of a potential spouse would almost make one believe that nietzsches aloofness towards the opposite stems not from disdain but from a strange sense of responsibility in not wanting to torment any woman with the eccentricities of his person unfortunately the rest of this very same letter makes such a claim nearly impossible to defend

section of commonwealth act no provides for the filing of a report with congress by the president as soon as that body convened according to the majority opinion on that date the whole act no ceased to have force and effect under that theory as soon as the congress convened in june and it is to be presumed that president osmea complying with his duty must have made his report of all the numerous executive orders he had issued so far perhaps including those issued by his predecessor president quezon who because of his premature death was unable to report his acts to congress the president automatically lost his emergency powers but the majority opinion qualifies this convening of the congress for it says that it must be a regular session and not a special session thereby extending the life of commonwealth act no one year longer to may when congress held its first regular session after liberation i do not quite see the necessity or the reason for the distinction made between the special and regular session for at both sessions congress could well receive the report of the president the reason given is that in a special session congress may consider general legislation or only such subjects as he president may designate but as a matter of fact the first two special sessions called by president osmea in after liberation each for a period of thirty days were both to consider general legislation so actually there is no reason for the distinction

i dont watch the biggest loser too much anymore its great to see so many people lose so much weight but its just more of the same one of the things that ive grown tired of is the role that the trainers tend to take on the personal hearttoheart talks in front of millions of people peppered throughout the show end up with the trainers counseling the contestants they are in great physical condition but in a way that actually makes them less qualified to offer advice in these instances

i recently came across an article in time business by margaret heffernan that shared the secrets of people who are very productive i was a little surprised at a couple of the habits so i thought i would share them with you according to the article it boils down to four things these people have a life the article suggests academic research keeps showing external commitments are highly correlated with high achievement they take breaks from what i understand when you get tired you can quickly become rigid and narrowminded and a quick break may be all that is needed to get those creative productive juices going again more on that later these people have often worked in different industries while this makes sense to me i was surprised to see it on the list having a diverse background allows you to see different frameworks and approaches we discussed this in the diversity enhances productivity post from november the final attribute these people have great outside collaborators and networks what the article really suggests is productive people have very wide rich resources to call on the secret to productivity isnt the latest tool or being better organized its having a complete life

ah memories if you grew up in britain in the seventies television was a wonderful thing in the early and late afternoon crammed with shows whose appeal has yet to completely wane from the sheer animated eccentricity of the magic roundabout through to the outer space freaky socialist moon creature whimsy of the clangers and on to the rather more socially aware paddington bear its impossible not to talk about these shows without getting wistful and dreamy filled with knowing jokey nods to the adults in the room the overall concept seemed to be about family viewing rather than simply sitting children down in front of the television by themselves

i am also getting paid less than i have ever been paidever and the only way to rectify that is to finish my masters degree except to do that i need money if i dont enroll in a class this fall i am suspended from the program and must reapply to get back in which i dont have time for yet because i left ky early my checks are smaller and because wa schools dont start until almost a month later than what im used to there looks to be a month where im not getting a paycheck to begin with nevermind the fact that i have no sick leave built up because i am new to this wa district if this kid is not here by tuesday i have to take maternity leave and start burning complimentary sick leave if this kid comes on his due date i still have to take maternity leave but will have burned through all of my complimentary sick leave prior to being able to go to work which leaves me taking deductions in my pay before i even set foot in the door with students not to mention that both my son and i will require regular doctors appointments to assess our health status after delivery and that each of those days will then be docked against my paychecks too heaven forbid one or both of us ever get sick and i have to take days off then because again it will be unpaid just accounting for maternity leave and the late start to the school year my next paycheck may not be for another months and while i have tried my best to prepare for this i am uncertain that i can be a financially contributing member to my nuclear family considering how my husband treated me upon facing the fact that i might not be generating any incoming while going through the job hunting process i do not necessarily relish the idea that hes going to see me as some burden to carry and make no qualms about letting me know that all things considered it seems extremely unlikely that going to school this fall can happen financially which will just have an awesome domino effect on our finances seeing as how ill have to reapply to the program and it delays finishing the program in enough time for it to affect my next years salary

what is the nature of the agreement between these sections of the media and mobs and criminals in search of spectacle does the media which positions itself at the scene in advance have a guarantee that the attacks and demonstrations will be nonviolent what happens if there is criminal trespass as there was today or even something worse does the media then become accessory to the crime this question is important given that some tv channels and newspapers are in the process of brazenly inciting mob anger against me in the race for sensationalism the line between reporting news and manufacturing news is becoming blurred so what if a few people have to be sacrificed at the altar of trp ratings the government has indicated that it does not intend to go ahead with the charges of sedition against me and the other speakers at a recent seminar on azadi for kashmir

the other night after dinner benjamin asked to watch some of the old videos i have on the computer for some reason this kid loves to watch videos of himself especially ones from previous birthday parties he could watch these videos for hours anyway i pulled up some videos from about years ago and one of the videos was of a year old caleb walking with his walker and so proud of himself while doing it it hit me like a ton of bricks and sadness just washed over me he cant do that now he cant even stand up much less walk he is weeks postop and he still has no strength is his legs none i had no idea how important calebs ability to walk was to me until now i hate it i hate that he cant walk right now i hate that he cant do any of the things he was doing before the surgery just months ago he was doing amazing he was walking of the day at school he was practicing with his tripod canes he was climbing up the steps of our slide he was walking walking walking i know i know it can take awhile for function to return but i really expected him to be doing more by now everyone has told me that he will get it backbut im not so sure i had someone tell me it could take a full year a year are you serious to be honest i hesitate to write this post because it sounds like im having a tantrum and a big ole pity party and the truth is i am having a tantrum and a pity party this stinks this blog is my journal and good or bad im going to be honest and get my thoughts and feelings our there because it will make me feel better this isnt about the wheelchair i love calebs wheelchair and have known for a very long time that it would be a permanent part of his life im okay with that but apparently im not okay with him not being able to walk when he wants to im not okay with the fact that he has lost this ability im not okay and i dont know if he is okay with it how frustrating must it be for him to completely lose this ability he knows he cant walk right now he knows he cant stand up and he knows that he could before that has to do something to him he must feel sadness or somethingalthough he hasnt voiced anything to me i dont want to make it sound like walking is the end all be all because i know its not caleb was doing far more than i ever expected he would be able to do i never dreamed he would walk with just afos and a walker my heart just hurts right now i just need to vent and cry and throw my fit ill suck it up and move on but right now i need to be sad and maybe all of this will seem silly months down the road if caleb regains the function he lost maybe ill look back on this tantrum and realize how i overreacted and just didnt give caleb enough time caleb has always needed more time to reach milestones it is the story of his life nothing has ever come easy for him and really this is about him not me i just love him so much and i just hate that he had to go through this i hate that everything is so hard for him and i hate that he has to work and work and work i feel like all the ground he has gained over the last few years all the hard work is gone he is back at square one so im grumpy and this mom is having a tantrum so there

illuminate has beautiful packaging with a stunning cover and a strong premise combining to promise us an equally beautiful story full of danger and intrigue as well as a taste of heaven and while ms agresti is undoubtedly a talented writer with a flare for detailed descriptions the story itself takes a great deal of time to really build and we read page after page hoping for a snowball effect to kick inwishing the quiet beginning would start to gain substance as the mystery of lexington hotels owners and staff unfolds but instead we find the frozen flakes slip right through our fingers and prevent us from building anything greater than the sum of its individual parts all the pieces of a fantastic story are present and accounted for but somehow they dont quite come completely together our investment in haven and her plight tangled up in a large number of words that dont seem altogether vital or necessary to the progression of the plot as a whole

some girls start in life with the idea that to snub the opposite is the surest way of bringing it to their feet all such imaginings are vain a man may be amused by the coquettish impertinences of a girl he may even be attracted by it to a certain extent but in the end he feels repulsion and unless it be the exception that proves the rule hastens away presently to lay his name and fortune at the disposal of some more modest girl

wards book is impressive well researched insightful and compelling it reflects a comprehensive study of lewiss life and work as it plays out in the narnia books this substructure that ward has identified is undoubtedly there furthermore i would venture to say that once you see it you cannot unsee it as a result planet narnia is a worthwhile read for anyone who is passionate both about narnia and lewis but here i offer a caution if you are merely interested in narnia you may find wards broader treatment of lewiss thought and life daunting it is after all a rather exhaustive assessment but if you are interested in lewiss work beyond the narnia books i think you will find in wards volume a handy guide to the thinking behind the man who invented narnia the book isnt perfect of course a few of wards planetary discussions could have made clearer connections and his theorizing about the occasion of the narniad was unconvincing but the overwhelming impression of the book is one of wonderful groundbreaking scholarship into the thinking of cs lewis

unfortunately ragnarok is still on hiatus and has been in that state forat least years there are currently volumes and according to wikipedia ragnarok is supposed to have volumes suffice it to say i have no hopes of this series going out of its hiatus state because honestly years probably more is a of a long break and with the sheer scale of detail and story that lies within ragnarok i think it is going to be hard for myungjin lee to get back into the swing of things unless he has the plot all nicely written outhaha well i can dream

however that theme along with a lot of the jokes seem to somehow get lost in the shuffle of this hour and minute movie it seems like every romcom lately has started to fall into this path where they arent just about being a funny romantic movie but they also have to have a huge deal of drama in it too just so it can even things out the film seems very disjointed in parts as it was more just a bunch of sketches put together but they were still funny enough to hold me over and get past it but by last couple of acts where the film shows violet and toms relationship starting to crumble down the film starts to get a bit darker and focus more on the sadness these two have away from each other rather than focus on some cool moments of comedy its actually a big downer when these two arent together because not only does it take a lot of steam out of the comedy but the idea of these two being perfect for each other is uprooted as well

now i have to say that i too have issues with the iaafs selection process which basically takes the aoy and turns it into a popularity contest take the mens finalists for example usain bolt yohan blake and david rudisha while blake and bolt did indeed have nice seasons with a couple of high points their overall seasons were not extraordinary not on par with athletes like mo farah and robert harting but jamaican fans are rabid and they vote in huge numbers over and over resulting in the popular bolt emerging as aoy on the mens side at the end of the day thats the decision that should have us looking at the iaaf system of selecting the aoy

as for quitting unschooling is not quitting unschooling is choosing to learn in the way we were designed and you can quit employment i have quit many jobs because they were toxic and interfered with what was most important to me my family leaving certain financial securities hasnt been easy i have worked harder at finding an employment situation that provides most closely the life that my family wants than if i had stayed miserable and you can quit family it often seems more people do than dont we have chosen to commit to family regardless of the challenges and there have been plenty i completely agree that you can not decide you want something and then not work to get it radically unschooling is so much work we have to be so much more present than before we have to pay close attention to our children to support what they choose to learn without interfering or putting our own agendas in the way i have been a teacher so this has been really hard for me instead of following traditional parenting strategies we now have to be amazingly present calm and supportive yelling is easy timeout is easy taking away privileges is easy spanking is easy i could go on but i think the point is made i often work a split shift so i can be home at times during the day to support my kids sometimes i work days a week in order to be more present and often of the days start at am and end between and pm working a regular job seems pretty easy in comparison

the remarkable thing about these two athletes is that even though they had barely any dialog at all for years they now admit that they were always thinking of each other even then before either of them had any solidified understanding of what they meant to each other they were already influencing each others game competing with the mere idea of one another inspired to improve and excel by the others standards and above all there was an unspoken inexplicable affinity there

in this post i will go in depth of what this looks like it means to view things through the looking glass of eternity it was to gain a perspective of how things measure up according to an eternal view i cant stress enough how important and timely this first truth was for me through the fire when i thought i couldnt go on anymore guided me through it and at the end only when i had completed the trial did he award his saint with this important truth of having an eternal perspective once i gained this my world changed completely my attitude my service my time in prayer and the wordit all changed for the better and even persisted to some large degree throughout the rest of my time i started getting this thought that orchestrates all things for his will because he is sovereign and so whenever something went wrong when viewed in my flesh i had to go to prayer and ask what the purpose of it was i had to seek the eternal value in it if it was something petty that ultimately didnt effect my salvation or the salvation of others or wasnt a sin issue then i could view it as rubbish and toss it out i would so to speak lay these things on a scale and see how they weighed up to things eternally if they didnt weigh up it was rubbish looking at the world through this view has changed how i choose to respond to things and how i choose to allow them to affect me most things dont weigh up and so i respond to them as such now with that being said i dont just ignore things as theyre presented i take it to and i ask him to show me the truth or the error in them and take them in stride its a freeing thing this kingdom perspective

rather than using fabric glue you can use textile medium its more flexible than fabric glue and it does not stiffen the fabric the beauty of it is you can brush it onto the outer surface and use a tool to get into those hardto reach crevices like the lips nose and corners of the eyes you can completely saturate the fabric and sort of mold it like clay and as i just mentioned it wont leave the fabric stiff how cool is that

i paddle a canoe as a pasttime beyond the simple mechanics of paddling is the actual dance of the canoe we create the sheer poetry of motion by making a rhythm or even music with the canoe literally making the canoe dance just as there are no wrong notes in making music at least in the purest sense even if we dont know the exact correct paddle strokes we can move that canoe creating our own poetry or dance as we become more proficient in paddling we can create a more intricate dance but when we come to add emotion to our paddling we create a vision then that canoe dance almost seems to takes on a life of its own it is more than just mere paddlingalmost as if that canoe becomes an extension of ourselves freeing ourselves and the canoe is the vehicle or instrument to such freedom the freedom found in making beautiful music together with my canoe mike ormsby

during the riots enoch explained that the way to find out what was going on was to read european media because british media obfuscates the truth those riots he pointed out were attacks on the police at the heart of the recent riots there were also attacks on the police which included firing at them with handguns in birmingham the media behave like the media in the soviet union where what the ideology said was happening was pushed by media rather than what was really happening russians were constantly told there was no crime in russia

i disagree partly with the argument made by bruce robinson that if the b of e did not bail out nr then it would be the depositors not the shareholders and management that suffered in fact today after the chancellor has said the government will use taxpayers money to bail out the bank its shares and the shares of the other banks likely to be next in line at the begging bowl alliance and leicester and bradford and bingley have soared clearly the main beneficiaries have indeed been those shareholdres and the management that undoubtedly also has many shares and share options the whole basis of capitalist ideology is that owners of capital make profits for taking risks but if capitalists can make huge profits and capital gains by making risky decisions such as those made by nr and the other banks yet are guaranteed against going bust by the government where is the risk in fact that is the whole basis on which neoliberalism operates at a macro as opposed to micro economic level and where it differs with classic liberalism

the bottom line is that terms such as father and son that are descriptive of and jesus are human terms used to help us understand the relationship between the different persons of the trinity if you can understand the relationship between a human father and a human son then you can understand in part the relationship between the first and second persons of the trinity the analogy breaks down if you try to take it too far and teach as some christian cults such as the jehovahs witnesses that jesus was literally begotten as in produced or created by the father

values are not central to todays world or so proclaimed the author of an article published in the global times covering the recent brics brazil russia india china and south africa summit in new delhi the article is an unapologetic and only marginally ungrammatical preemptive strike against western neerdowells seeking to undermine the brics union by pointing out a lack of unified values among member countries the article argues that universal values held in common between countries arent that important rather it is what they can give each other that counts the message is that potential mutual benefits outweigh a lack of shared values though it rarely strays from its uniformly histrionic tone neatly slotting each brics country into the distinctly chinese narrative of facing oppression by developed countries in the current global political system the article nevertheless highlights an incredibly interesting trend arising in modern chinese politics value bashing

like a comic it spends very little time on back story diving straight into the plot with the luxury of having most of their character development done on earlier episodes but this shows the characters learning to interact as a team we learn a bit more about hawkeye and black widow and we get to see how even though they are only highly trained humans they get to play a part in team of powerhouses like iron man hulk and thor in particular id say the surprise for me was really how right the hulk and banner are in this film and im glad that mark ruffalo has agreed to do more films featuring the hulk as banner he is very carefully calm and quiet with a wry humour as the hulk we get to see him on a raging rampage but also later as the calmer powerhouse easily ripping through the enemy ranks he also has more brutal sense of humour with some excellent scenes that really stand out and im not surprised the general reaction after seeing the film is a desire for more hulk

im absolutely confused by how other people view this season and pretty much angel in general im not too surprised that the magic bullet isnt a top ten for everyone but at that puts it in the middle of the pack that was hardly a mediocre episode my next few picks also find themselves in a mediocre range as ranked by others yet the season finale and premier both rank much higher than i have them those are transition episodes and while they are necessary they are not entertaining episodes the finale is totally tacked on and just serves as a bridge to the next season yet that ranks in the top im not surprised that spin the bottle is ranked much higher than where i have it it is a showy episode that is directed by whedon that i just am not enamored with because the premise is so tired ill give that a pass since i can see why people would get excited about it but the rest of these rankings just baffle me

as for the songs theres not really any point in going through all of them one at a time since for the most part they are done fairly similarly to the originals well sort of structurally and in essence theyre mostly the same as before but there are enough changes to keep the songs sounding fresh this time around and you and i receives the most noticable change the quiet acoustic opening is replaced with an immediate display of the gargantuan eclipse section and while im not thrilled with that development the track doesnt sound worse for it but there are other subtlties for instance the opening section of ctte is significantly reworked with howe playing faster and more aggressively than ever before

left out were the widely held views that the war should never have been fought because it was a war to extend us hegemony or that the us simply had no business fighting in someone elses civil war further the first acceptable viewpoint implied and the second explicitly stated that the us didnt really fight hard to win the war ignoring the actual intensive level of the us war effort in which north vietnams urban and rural infrastructures were destroyed and three million vietnamese were killed and lest that media debate be seen as a backlash from the right it was the liberal new york times that led it thus there was all the appearance of a free and open media at the same time that the media obscured

she brought up the topic gently almost as if expecting me to stammer out a request to close the subject and leave it that way but i found that once removed from the situation i was able to confront it with a little more ease i told her what i thought id heard and danced around a million different possible explanations for what it could have been everything from fillings in our teeth picking up a nearby radio station to an old phonograph player that could have been stored up there and could have fallen over after fifty years and scratched out a snippet of song whose lyrics we mistakenly took to be some ghostly voice from beyond i figured it was much easier to believe either of those scenarios than to consider any otherworldly possibility but the explanation that occurred to jane as we lay there in bed sleepless was a bit more frightening than any maybe theres someone living up there that my grandparents dont know about she said and a look of startled concern came over her face

it wasnt that my parents hated their kids and wanted to pump and plump us up with preservatives and other bad things they simply didnt know any better had their own personal issues with food and werent really interested in food the way i am to learn more about just what it was we were putting into our bodies
the main stance i was holding in my part of the debate was that a person must always stay honest and true for the moment one starts with lies he will never end and these lies will eventually get caught i then brought an example how the other teams stance can be taken out of proportion and may cause more damage and harm rather that what they are so desperately trying to protect maybe the example i brought may have been a little too harsh and direct for some individuals maybe it had offended him personally yet a debate is a debate my aim and goal was not to be correct or right it was to get a certain message across i did not make it personal and nor was i expecting anyone else to take things personally however that one specific individual decided to take it personally and very personally indeed he went to contact the whole group to complain to them about how he felt and went on complaining about how wrong i have been in bringing up my example this statement has not been confirmed and i am only assuming this simply based of the outcome i suddenly started getting text messages from a whole bunch of people saying that i was wrong and that i shouldnt have done what i have done and that the other individual was hurt i even got a text message around four in the morning i found this very odd and strange if that individual had an issue with me personally he should have picked up the phone and called me directly i would explain to him and clarify to him on a more personal level instead the individual never called me nor contacted me he simply posted in the forum how wrong i was

week on writing an action scene that would take fifteen seconds to watch on film and dare i say it would probably be more effective in that medium though obviously the novel trumps film in many other respects i have to agree ive also seen it argued at least that woolfs own experimental writing might have been influenced by cinema montage and the shifting of camera angles and distances

yes the plank machinecontrolled set is a rather ugly and distractingly noisy thing yes robert lepages production suggests someone reliant more on momentary inspiration than on grand overarching vision and sure the metropolitan opera orchestras performance under fabio luisi mostly seemed blandly competent rather than inspired all of this may well start to bug me more in the later longer installments of lepages new production of the complete ring cycle if not corrected for the relatively trim das rheingold however there were just enough moments of visual splendorthe planks contorting to create a distorted stairwell for instance as well as some of the video projectionsto satisfy me and of course the opera itself is glorious its thematic elementsits skeptical view of mans folly the damaging effects of unchecked power on the human soul etcstill come through amidst lepages technological gimcrackery and the music is still as brilliant as ever for a novice of wagners ring of the nibelung live this was fine not transcendent not thoughtprovoking and not especially affecting but fine well see how the rest of this new metropolitan opera production shakes out

thus its vanishingly rare to see any public discussion of historical events these days that doesnt fixate often to the extent of caricature on distinguishing the good guys from the bad guysand when this is attempted the first reaction of a great many listeners or readers is to figure out how to cram whats been said into that same simplistic moral dualism while theres a point to applying ethical philosophy to history and vice versa though there are entire realms of understanding that cant be reached so long as the center of discussion is who was right and who was wrong over the next few weeks i plan on talking about the rise of americas current empire as a historical phenomenon and not a morality play and leave my readers free to make their own moral judgments if they find those useful

 c after thanking pm meles for the meeting and noting the positive usethiopian relationship sen feingold asked the pm about ethiopian plans for dealing with somalia meles replied that the situation in somalia had deteriorated significantly in the last six months like the taliban in afghanistan the cic had filled a political vacuum in somalia providing security and stability in areas that they controlled meles said the cic was also riding a wave of resurgent jihadism in the region which had been encouraged by developments in iraq and afghanistan he noted that the cic had been implementing the same brand of radical islam espoused by other extremists as was evidenced by their censoring of television programming and cinemas as well as their ban on khat meles acknowledged that somalis had traditionally resisted such extreme interpretations of islam but also remarked that somalis liked to back a winning horse and jihadists had accumulated a string of victories that was winning converts to their cause this gathering military momentum had allowed a relatively small group of extremists to dominate the large and diverse organizations who formed the cic meles said cic leaders sheik aweys aidan ayro and hassan alturki had direct connections to al qaeda that were known to intelligence services including in the us he agreed with sen feingolds suggestion that the cic could be considered a franchise of al qaeda

a default by either of those large countries would have disastrous implications for the banks and other financial institutions in france and germany the european financial stability fund is large enough to cover greeces financing needs but not large enough to finance italy and spain if they lose access to private markets so european politicians hope that by showing that even greece can avoid default private markets will gain enough confidence in the viability of italy and spain to continue lending to their governments at reasonable rates and financing their banks

no other religion has as much evidence for it as the bible again could you point to some actual evidence and not some christian apologist websites however i would sooner be a muslim than a christian because unlike jesus muhammed actually existed he didnt ride up to heaven on a flying horse and he wasnt contacted by an angel but at least he was a real historical figure but let us say that jesus was real and the events of the bible were mostly accurate for the sake of argument let us even say that jesus rose from the dead and did all of those miracles that the bible says he did again for the sake of argument that in no way definitively proves the existence of a god or gods it may prove a supernatural of some kind but no deities of any kind i am still quite comfortable in my lack of belief in your god and every other god out there whether or not jesus was real until some real evidence comes out to prove your god i still wont believe why would i if there is no evidence threats of eternal damnation not good enough either

brad the garage has one of the more unique atmospheres of any bar i have been to in previous trips i have gone with one thing in mind overpay for a beer and ensure good conversation with friends this trip the goal was to enjoy some solid pubgrub and not hear the same recycled jokes greg will vote for romney joey is unemployed and has roommates i love creed and blake is stupid only two of those are true by the way sadly only half of my mission was met the joint was filled and it was incredibly musty inside not the most comfortable of dining environments i went with the smoked turkey and swiss on wheat with lettuce tomato and cucumbers it was priceless literally the menu was devoid of numbers so i hadnt any idea what i was paying nice to see that somewhere in this wonderfully progressive state the lottery exists somewhere the sandwich came served with wavy lays and a pickle i washed it down with water as i wasnt sure a soda would push my tab over bones the sandwich was good but i feel i could have made it myself it was rather average and i feel that if the cucumbers were missing this would have been a disappointment after enjoying my meal i rolled the dice and headed to pay not bad at all wish i could say the same for the temperature inside and the quality of food the garage is a great place to enjoy a cold beer and they have plenty varieties to choose from sadly this was not a bar review youre better off eating before you arrive and saving the scratch for a nice good people brown or other libation of choice

last year the final man of his graduating squad from boot camp was killed in action in afghanistan making our son the sole survivor of his squad that graduated from boot camp together i will never forget when our son graduated from boot camp and the major told all of us parents to look around the room of graduates and to realize that or more of these kids would not come home except in body bags that is a slap of reality but the bigger slap is to realize that your son is the sole survivor of his graduating squad we dont need one day set aside to remember those that are in harms way today and everyday and those that didnt make it back to finish living their lives here back at home we have a constant reminder that hangs on our wall of those guys that we laughed and talked with prior to their service to our country and proudly remember them and their surviving family members on a daily basis we are truly grateful that our son survived however being a sole survivors parent it really makes us thankful and humble to have our son who now has a wife and young boys of his own safe back here at home

abstract art specifically painting has become such an excepted idiom that it is a valid alternative to a landscape when decorating your home or office in addition or because of this abstraction almost immediately leaves a bad taste in your mouth especially when seen in a gallery or museum the general public and the intheknow artcrowds alike have a distaste for it these days while it is seen as especially suited for public spaces any location that could use a bit of color in the form of nonthreatening splashes and dabs any serious consideration of abstraction is extremely frowned upon abstraction has given birth to the ageold and never wornout impulse of my child could do that an argument the aesthetes have yet to convincingly rebut this is all the more difficult when theory has chucked out modernism and greenberg rosenberg on the one hand we are attacking abstraction symbolized by the abstract expressionists for our own postmodern reasons on the other we dont want to be in the same category as the debased masses so what are art people to do abstraction is at once arguably a much accepted option especially in the halls of painting departments at art schools across the land but it is also ignored even despised by the reigning opinions and trends of todays art world
