ring a bell
on the one hand
on the other hand
have an open mind
keep an open mind
on the tip of your tongue
a hangover
fed up
Big deal
Givea hand
let the cat out of the bag
give it a shot
No way
The more the merrier
give it your all
first-hand
a dead end
time flies
pull’s leg
haveon your mind
keep track
from scratch
off the top of your head
learn your lesson
keep in mind
bear in mind
speak your mind
Just my luck
There’s nothing to it
get out of hand
cut a long story short
a piece of cake
go out of your way to do 
cross your mind
road rage
go on about
slip your mind
have a fit
throw a fit
The ball is in your court
make your day
a rip off
get a kick out of 
catch’s eye
jump the gun
givea piece of your mind
cross your fingers
cost an arm and a leg
be in hot water
an eye opener
let off steam
read between the lines
go all out
out of line
be on’s back
would not be seen dead
would not be caught dead
have mixed feelings
draw a blank
You name it
know your stuff
left, right and centre
a change of heart
a long haul
be man enough
be second to none
learn the ropes
a breath of fresh air
get your act together
set your heart on 
take for granted
play it by ear
put all your eggs in one basket
Birds of a feather
have second thoughts
pay the price for
a basket case
on the dot
not have a clue
have a shot at
the word spread
safe and sound
be a pain in the neck
be in the same boat
be at home
feel at home
be in ’s good books
get out of bed on the wrong side
up-and-coming
get into gear
out of the blue
set the record straight
keep an eye on 
a grey area
get off the hook
let off the hook
out of sight out of mind
givethe cold shoulder
The ins and outs
line of work
make do 
getoff your chest
knowlike the back of your hand
in the bag
be on the ball
off and on
on and off
for the time being
burn your bridges
get the sack
on the back burner
get cold feet
hit rock bottom
talk shop
start the ball rolling
get the ball rolling
get your foot in the door
well off
well to do
pull your weight
a gut feeling 
if need be
in the middle of nowhere
go with the flow 
play your cards right
follow in footsteps
have your heart set on 
You can say that again
I’m all ears
small talk
puton hold
common ground
politically correct
politically incorrect
have had it up to here
have your work cut out 
get the picture
see eye to eye
call it a day
twist arm
bringto light 
be in the dark
keeping the dark
go up in smoke
go downhill
at your fingertips
poke fun at
Easier said than done
the bottom line
call the shots
know by heart
learn by heart
get a move on
miss the point
hold your ground
stand your ground
be child’s play
be only a matter of time
push your luck
raise a few eyebrows
a matter of opinion
be that as it may
if push comes to shove
when push comes to shove
against your better judgement
add insult to injury
the last straw
be up in the air
not have the faintest
not have the foggiest idea
the icing on the cake
get on the bandwagon
jump on the bandwagon
leap on the bandwagon
the fine print
the small print
stuck in a rut
be in a rut
run of the mill
face the music
to keep at bay
be up in arms
bite your tongue
leave a lot to be desired
off the beaten track
pick brains
whet your appetite
sour grapes
a blessing in disguise
givethe benefit of the doubt
jog memory
foot the bill
have it in for 
be in the red
get wind of
catch wind of 
a rule of thumb
be on the same wavelength
up to speed
play devil’s advocate
bend over backwards
lean over backwards
pass the buck
call your bluff
have a chip on your shoulder
breathe down’s neck
climb to the top of the career
climb to the top of the corporate ladder
red tape
Give free rein
the be all and end all
blowout of proportion
take the plunge
in a bind
break the ice
bury the hatchet
A hot potato
A penny for your thoughts
Actions speak louder than words
Add insult to injury
An arm and a leg
At the drop of a hat
Back to the drawing board
Ball is in your court
Barking up the wrong tree
Be glad to see the back of
Beat around the bush
Best of both worlds
Best thing since sliced bread
Bite off more than you can chew
Blessing in disguise
Burn the midnight oil
Can't judge a book by its cover
Caught between two stools
Costs an arm and a leg
Cross that bridge when you come to it
Cry over spilt milk
Curiosity killed the cat
Cut corners
Cut the mustard
Devil's Advocate
Don't count your chickens before the eggs have hatched
Don't give up the day job
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Drastic times call for drastic measures
Elvis has left the building
Every cloud has a silver lining
Far cry from
Feel a bit under the weather
Give the benefit of the doubt
Hear it on the grapevine
Hit the nail on the head
Hit the sack
In the heat of the moment
It takes two to tango
Jump on the bandwagon
Keep something at bay
Kill two birds with one stone
Last straw
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let the cat out of the bag
Make a long story short
Method to my madness
Miss the boat
Not a spark of decency
Not playing with a full deck
Off one's rocker
On the ball
Once in a blue moon
Picture paints a thousand words
Piece of cake
Put wool over other people's eyes
See eye to eye
Sit on the fence
Speak of the devil
Steal someone's thunder
Take with a grain of salt
Taste of your own medicine
To hear something straight from the horse's mouth
Whole nine yards
Wouldn't be caught dead
Your guess is as good as mine
